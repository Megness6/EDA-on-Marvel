asgardian pa,"This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. [the voice becomes more desperate and pleading] Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft!"
ebony maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan... You may think this is suffering... No. it is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos."
Thor,[now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.
thanos,"[to Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference."
Loki,"Oh, I do. Kill away!"
Loki,"[starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!"
Thor,We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
Thor,You really are the worst brother.
Loki,"[While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again."
thanos,"Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian."
Loki,"Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk."
ebony maw,Let him have his fun.
Heimdall,[prays] Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.
thanos,That was a mistake.
Thor,NO!!! [after Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!
ebony maw,[shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shhh.
ebony maw,"[kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp."
thanos,"There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan."
proxima midnight,"[kneeling] Father, we will not fail you."
Loki,"[Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject… If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
thanos,[unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.
Loki,"I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity."
thanos,"""Undying."" You should choose your words more carefully."
Loki,"[Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him]"
thanos,[walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor] No resurrections this time.
Thor,No… Loki…
doctor e,[dressed in casual American clothes] Seriously? You don't have any money?
Wong,[dressed as Wong is always dressed] Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
doctor e,I'll tell the guys at the deli. [wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.
Wong,"Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200."
doctor e,Dollars?
Wong,Rupees.
doctor e,Which is?
Wong,"Uh, buck and a half."
doctor e,What do you want?
Wong,I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.
Bruce Banner,Thanos is coming. He's coming...
doctor e,"[Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?"
Tony Stark,"Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding."
Pepper Potts,[laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.
Tony Stark,"[also talking over her] No, I'm not."
Pepper Potts,Lost me.
Tony Stark,"Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?"
Pepper Potts,Yeah.
Tony Stark,"Okay, and then you're like, ""Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?"" ""Oh! Someone's watching."" ""I'm gonna go in my pants."""
Pepper Potts,"Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee."
Tony Stark,Yes.
Pepper Potts,Yeah. Everybody has that.
Tony Stark,"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"
Pepper Potts,[Nodding in understanding] Right.
Tony Stark,Morgan! Morgan.
Pepper Potts,"So you woke up, and thought that we were..."
Tony Stark,Expecting.
Pepper Potts,Yeah.
Tony Stark,[Becoming excited] Yes?
Pepper Potts,[Shaking her head] No.
Tony Stark,I had a dream about it. It was so real.
Pepper Potts,"If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that."
Tony Stark,"I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles."
Pepper Potts,"It's not helping your case, OK?"
Tony Stark,"No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-"
Pepper Potts,[insistently] You don't need that.
Tony Stark,"I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know..."
Pepper Potts,Shirts?
Tony Stark,You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Pepper Potts,You should have shirts in your closet.
Tony Stark,Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Pepper Potts,Yes.
Tony Stark,I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]
doctor e,"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way."
Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?"
doctor e,"We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
Tony Stark,"And who's ""we""?"
Bruce Banner,"[emerges from behind Doctor e] Hey, Tony."
Tony Stark,[looking surprised] Bruce.
Bruce Banner,Pepper.
Pepper Potts,Hi.
Tony Stark,You okay?
Wong,"[Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence."
doctor e,[Each Stone lights up as Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
Tony Stark,[very attentive] Tell me his name again.
Bruce Banner,"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him."
Tony Stark,[Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?
Bruce Banner,"No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony..."
doctor e,He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.
Tony Stark,"[Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run] Did you seriously just say ""hitherto undreamt of""?"
doctor e,Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Tony Stark,Is that what this is...?
Tony Stark,"[looking offended] [straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?"
doctor e,No can do.
Wong,We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony Stark,"And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so..."
doctor e,Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony Stark,It's not bad.
doctor e,A bit chalky.
Wong,"""A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge"" is our favorite."
Bruce Banner,That's a thing?
Tony Stark,things change.
doctor e,Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony Stark,"And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us."
doctor e,"Well, if we don't do our jobs."
Tony Stark,"[Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?"
doctor e,"[Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag."
Bruce Banner,"Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now."
Tony Stark,"[awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing."
Bruce Banner,What do you mean?
Tony Stark,"Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline."
Bruce Banner,"What? Tony, you lost another super bot?"
Tony Stark,I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
doctor e,"Who could find Vision, then?"
Tony Stark,[quietly to himself] Shit. [to the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.
doctor e,"[sighing in exasperation] Oh, great."
Tony Stark,Maybe. But... [sighs]
Bruce Banner,[missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.
Tony Stark,"It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?"
Bruce Banner,No.
Tony Stark,The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Bruce Banner,[Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony Stark,Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner,"[Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."
Tony Stark,"Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?"
doctor e,"[Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no."
Tony Stark,You okay?
Tony Stark,"Help him! Wong, Doc."
Bruce Banner,Go! Got it!
Tony Stark,"[Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?"
f.r.i.d.a.y.,"Not sure, I'm working on it."
Tony Stark,"Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!"
doctor e,[Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.
peter parker,"[Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
ned leeds,[Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!
Tony Stark,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
f.r.i.d.a.y.,Will do.
ebony maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..."
Tony Stark,"[Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
ebony maw,[Looks at e] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?
doctor e,"Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]"
Tony Stark,"It means get lost, Squidward!"
ebony maw,He exhausts me.
cull obsidian,[Two untranslated syllables]
ebony maw,Bring me the Stone.
cull obsidian,[Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]
Tony Stark,"Banner, you want a piece?"
Bruce Banner,"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?"
Tony Stark,That's right.
Tony Stark,"Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
Bruce Banner,"I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man."
Tony Stark,Where's your guy?
Bruce Banner,I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
Tony Stark,There's no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner,I know.
Tony Stark,[points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.
Tony Stark,"[glances at e] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
Bruce Banner,"Tony, I'm sorry. [stammers] Either I can't or he won't-"
Tony Stark,"It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
Wong,I have him.
Bruce Banner,Damn it.
Bruce Banner,Where'd that come from?
Tony Stark,It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
doctor e,"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..."
Tony Stark,"Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
doctor e,It stays with me.
Tony Stark,Exactly. Bye.
Bruce Banner,"[Rushing over to Tony] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?"
Tony Stark,"Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?"
Bruce Banner,I'm trying. He won't come out.
Tony Stark,Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way]
Bruce Banner,"[Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!"
Bruce Banner,[Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree]
Bruce Banner,"What do you mean, ""no""?!"
peter parker,"Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?"
Tony Stark,"Kid, where'd you come from?"
peter parker,Field trip to MoMA.
peter parker,"What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?"
Tony Stark,He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
ebony maw,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
doctor e,It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
ebony maw,[Vehemently.] Then I'll take it off your corpse.
doctor e,You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.
ebony maw,"You'll only wish you were dead. [e falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Strange away] NO!"
Tony Stark,"[Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as e passes through the park] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it."
peter parker,On it!
peter parker,[untangles himself] Not cool!
peter parker,"Uhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!"
Tony Stark,"Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Tony to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Tony, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]"
Tony Stark,"[still in pursuit of the ship and his protégé.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you."
peter parker,"But you said save the wizard! [Peter, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!"
Tony Stark,You're too high up. You're running out of air.
peter parker,Yeah! That makes sense.
peter parker,"Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!"
Tony Stark,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
f.r.i.d.a.y,Yep.
peter parker,"OH, COME ON!"
f.r.i.d.a.y,"Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
Pepper Potts,"[Sounding heavily worried.] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?"
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
Pepper Potts,Why?
Tony Stark,[While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.
Pepper Potts,Tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark,Yeah.
Pepper Potts,"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship."
Tony Stark,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
Pepper Potts,"Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…"
Tony Stark,Pep…
Pepper Potts,Come back here right now! Come back!
f.r.i.d.a.y,"Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…"
peter parker,Oh my God! [looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus...
Bruce Banner,Where you going?
Wong,The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
Bruce Banner,[Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.
peter quill,"[chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!"
Rocket Raccoon,[yawns] Why are we doing this again?
Gamora,"[annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying."
Rocket Raccoon,"I get that, but why are we doing it?"
peter quill,Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Gamora,[waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.
peter quill,[points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…
Drax,We'll take his ship.
Rocket Raccoon,Exactly!
peter quill,B-b-b-bingo!
Mantis,[reading her console] We are arriving.
peter quill,"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot."
groot,[in a mocking tone] I am Groot!
peter quill,Whoa!
Rocket Raccoon,Language!
Gamora,Hey!
Drax,Wow.
peter quill,"You got some acorns on you, kid."
Rocket Raccoon,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!"
Mantis,What happened?
Rocket Raccoon,Looks like we're not getting paid.
Rocket Raccoon,(Waving his hands) Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!
peter quill,How the hell is this dude still alive?
Drax,"[Sounding awed.] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man."
peter quill,[A little dented.] I'm muscular.
Rocket Raccoon,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat."
peter quill,"Yeah, right."
Drax,It's true. You have gained a little weight… [Drax motions to his chin and belly]
peter quill,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…"
Mantis,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
peter quill,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket Raccoon,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?"
Gamora,"[reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers."
peter quill,"[snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up."
Mantis,[Places hand on Thor's forehead.] Wake.
Thor,Who the hell are you guys?
Gamora,"To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre..."
Drax,Including my own.
Gamora,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [she snaps her fingers]"
Thor,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor,Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]
peter quill,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]"
Thor,"Families can be tough. [he claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain."
peter quill,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-"""
Thor,"[not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon… (he attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…"
peter quill,What are you doing?
Thor,Taking your pod.
peter quill,"[deepens his voice] No, you're not! [mimics Thor’s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
Rocket Raccoon,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
peter quill,No.
Drax,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
peter quill,No I'm not.
Mantis,(gasp) He just did it again!
peter quill,This is my voice!
Thor,[steps closer to Quill.] Are you mocking me?
peter quill,Are you mocking me?
Thor,Stop it. You did it again.
peter quill,He's trying to copy me.
Thor,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
Gamora,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor,Knowhere.
Mantis,He must be going somewhere.
peter quill,"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores]"
Thor,Not anymore.
Gamora,Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?
Thor,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector."
peter quill,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."
Thor,Or a genius.
Gamora,[to Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Thor,"There's six stones out there. [finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers."
peter quill,The Avengers?
Thor,[by way of explanation.] They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis,Like Kevin Bacon?
Thor,"[pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome."
Gamora,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir."
Drax,That's a made up word.
Thor,All words are made up.
Rocket Raccoon,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
Thor,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you."
Rocket Raccoon,Rabbit?
Thor,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [to Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?"
Rocket Raccoon,You're very perceptive.
Thor,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
Rocket Raccoon,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go."
Thor,Wonderful.
peter quill,Except for that I'm the captain.
Thor,Quiet!
peter quill,That's my backpack.
Rocket Raccoon,Go sit down.
peter quill,"[to Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to… [gropes for ""Nidavellir""] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?"
Thor,The Thanos killing kind.
peter quill,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
Thor,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket Raccoon,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
Thor,A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop."
Thor,He already is.
Rocket Raccoon,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool."
Thor,So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]
peter quill,[to Rocket] For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Rocket Raccoon,"You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain."
Thor,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye."
Vision,[gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain]
Wanda Maximoff,Vis? Is it the stone again?
Vision,It's as if it's speaking to me.
Wanda Maximoff,What does it say?
Vision,I don't... I don't know. But something... 
Vision,Tell me what you feel.
Wanda Maximoff,I just feel you.
Wanda Maximoff,So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision,What if I miss that train?
Wanda Maximoff,There is an 11.
Vision,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?"
Wanda Maximoff,You gave Stark your word.
Vision,I'd rather give it to you.
Wanda Maximoff,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
Vision,"Not to each other. [he puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think..."
Wanda Maximoff,It works.
Vision,It works.
Vision,Then stay. Stay with me.
Vision,[suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping…
Wanda Maximoff,[fearful] What are they?
Vision,What the stone was warning me about. [he kisses her hand] I have to go.
Wanda Maximoff,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… Then maybe going isn't the best idea."
Vision,"Wanda, I… [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]"
Wanda Maximoff,"Vision! [she circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking Wanda across the street and through a bistro's window.]"
Vision,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Wanda Maximoff,Is that even possible?
Vision,"It isn't supposed to be. [his voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [Wanda gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed."
Wanda Maximoff,Vis!
corvus glaive,"[to Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives."
Wanda Maximoff,Hands off.
Wanda Maximoff,"[hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go."
Vision,Please. Please leave.
Wanda Maximoff,You asked me to stay... I'm staying.
Vision,Please.
Wanda Maximoff,Get up.
proxima midnight,[to Glaive] Get up.
corvus glaive,I can't.
Natasha Romanov,[coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
proxima midnight,You'll never get the chance again.
Sam Wilson,[to Vision] Can you stand?
Vision,"[electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain."
Steve Rogers,[nods] Let's get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanov,"[closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances."
Wanda Maximoff,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson,"Where to, Cap?"
Steve Rogers,Home.
Gamora,[to Young Gamora] Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
child of thanos,[untranslated inquiry]
ebony maw,Zehobereians…
young gamora,[being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!
ebony maw,"Choose a side, or die."
young gamora,Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves]
ebony maw,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few."
thanos,"What's wrong, little one?"
young gamora,My mother. Where is my mother?
thanos,[kneels down to Gamora.] What's your name?
young gamora,Gamora.
thanos,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small - for him - red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try."
ebony maw,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker."
thanos,Concentrate. There! You've got it.
peter quill,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-"
Gamora,I need to ask a favor.
peter quill,"Yeah, sure."
Gamora,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos."
peter quill,Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?
Gamora,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.
peter quill,[A beat. Confusion.] What?
Gamora,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.
peter quill,What do you know?
Gamora,"If I tell you, you'd know, too."
peter quill,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?"
Gamora,Only if you wanna die.
peter quill,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
Gamora,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me."
peter quill,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would… [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]"
Gamora,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
peter quill,[a beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.
peter quill,Dude. How long have you been standing there?
Drax,An hour.
peter quill,An hour? Are you serious?
Drax,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... That I become invisible to the eye... Watch.
peter quill,You're eating a zarg-nut.
Drax,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.
peter quill,"Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]"
Drax,I'm sure I'm invisible.
Mantis,"Hi, Drax."
Drax,[Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.
peter quill,This place looks deserted.
Drax,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.
peter quill,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here."
collector,I don't have it.
thanos,Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
thanos,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]"
collector,[strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
thanos,I imagine it's like breathing for you.
collector,Like suicide.
thanos,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
collector,I didn't know what it was.
thanos,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?"
Drax,Today...
peter quill,[grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.
Drax,...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
peter quill,"Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
Drax,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
Mantis,"Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]"
peter quill,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!"
thanos,"Why? [he falls down] Why you? Daughter… [he holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]"
peter quill,[surprised] That was quick.
collector,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
thanos,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing."
thanos,"That is, it was. Now… Reality can be whatever I want."
Gamora,"[her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come."
thanos,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one."
Drax,Thanos!
peter quill,"[Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!"
Gamora,Peter…
peter quill,[to Gamora] I told you to go right.
Gamora,Now? Really?
peter quill,You let her go!
thanos,"Ah, the boyfriend."
peter quill,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.
Gamora,Peter…
peter quill,Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!
Gamora,Not him.
Gamora,You promised! You promised.
thanos,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!"
peter quill,[tearing up] I told you to go right.
Gamora,"I love you, more than anything."
peter quill,"I love you, too."
thanos,[genuinely sincere] I like you.
secretary ross,Still no word from Vision?
james rhodes,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
secretary ross,On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
james rhodes,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?"
secretary ross,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own."
james rhodes,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here."
secretary ross,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
james rhodes,[sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [we get a good look at his leg braces]
secretary ross,You have second thoughts?
james rhodes,Not anymore.
Steve Rogers,Mr. Secretary.
secretary ross,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
Natasha Romanov,You could use some of that right now.
secretary ross,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?"
Steve Rogers,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Cap takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too."
secretary ross,[to Rhodes] Arrest them.
james rhodes,"All over it. [swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap."
Steve Rogers,"[hugging War Machine] You too, Rhodey. [Black Widow gets her own embrace]"
james rhodes,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.
Sam Wilson,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star."
Bruce Banner,"Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room] Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back."
Natasha Romanov,"Hi, Bruce."
Bruce Banner,Nat.
Sam Wilson,[whispering] This is awkward.
james rhodes,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?"
Wanda Maximoff,And they can clearly find us.
Bruce Banner,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
Natasha Romanov,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest."
Bruce Banner,Who's Scott?
Steve Rogers,Ant-Man.
Bruce Banner,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone."
Natasha Romanov,"Well then, we have to protect it."
Vision,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her]"
Wanda Maximoff,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation."
Vision,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
Wanda Maximoff,That's too high a price.
Vision,"[takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him."
Steve Rogers,"[Eyes diverted down.] But it should. [looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision."
Vision,"[walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?"
Bruce Banner,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
Wanda Maximoff,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
Bruce Banner,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts."
Natasha Romanov,Can we do that?
Bruce Banner,Not me. Not here.
james rhodes,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back."
Steve Rogers,I know somewhere.
okoye,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted."
T'challa,And the Border Tribe?
okoye,Those that are left.
T'challa,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
okoye,And what of this one?
T'challa,"This one may be tired of war. [Bucky Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough."
Bucky Barnes,[with resignation] Where's the fight?
T'challa,On its way.
ebony maw,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. [the needles start to contact e's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone."
Tony Stark,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
peter parker,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty..."
Tony Stark,What the-
peter parker,I know what you're gonna say.
Tony Stark,You should not be here.
peter parker,I was gonna go home -
Tony Stark,I don't wanna hear it.
peter parker,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...
Tony Stark,And now I gotta hear it.
peter parker,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here."
Tony Stark,(seriously) What did you just say?
peter parker,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
Tony Stark,Yeah. [Iron Man crosses to stand right in front of Spidey] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
peter parker,No. I did think this through.
Tony Stark,You could not have possibly thought this through.
peter parker,"It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood. [he waits for Iron Man's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say."
Tony Stark,"[breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [he leads Spider-Man over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Spidey crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go."
peter parker,"Um. Okay, okay...uh... [Spidey and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?"
ebony maw,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
ebony maw,...could end your friend's life in an instant.
Tony Stark,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
ebony maw,"[walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine."
Tony Stark,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies."
peter parker,Yes! Wait what are those?!
peter parker,"Hey, we haven't officially met. [he offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to e.] Cool."
doctor e,We've gotta turn this ship around.
Tony Stark,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
doctor e,"No, I want to protect the stone."
Tony Stark,"[irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening."
doctor e,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
Tony Stark,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
doctor e,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony Stark,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
doctor e,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you."
Tony Stark,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
peter parker,[raises his hand] I'm backup.
Tony Stark,No. You're a stowaway. [waggles a finger between himself and e] The adults are talking.
doctor e,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-what is he, your ward?"
peter parker,"No. I'm Peter, by the way."
doctor e,Doctor Strange.
peter parker,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then."
Tony Stark,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
doctor e,[walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Iron Man is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away] Stark?
Tony Stark,Yeah?
doctor e,Can you get us home?
Tony Stark,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
doctor e,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Tony Stark,"[stalks over to e] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?"
doctor e,"[pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it."
Tony Stark,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [stepping over to Spider-Man, he formally taps each of Spidey's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]"
thanos,I thought you might be hungry.
Gamora,I always hated that chair.
thanos,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
Gamora,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
thanos,"You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years."
Gamora,I was a child when you took me.
thanos,I saved you.
Gamora,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
thanos,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise."
Gamora,Because you murdered half the planet.
thanos,A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora,You're insane.
thanos,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
Gamora,You don't know that!
thanos,"[scowls as hs egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [he stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter."
Gamora,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
thanos,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."
Gamora,I'm sorry I disappointed you.
thanos,"I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [looks at her] And you lied."
Gamora,Nebula.
Gamora,Don't do this.
thanos,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."
Gamora,Please don't do this.
thanos,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
Gamora,"Stop. Stop it. [she puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone."
memory nebula,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them."
memory gamora,He can never get them all.
memory nebula,He will!
memory gamora,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it."
thanos,"[to Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [his voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stoes are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]"
Gamora,"Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir."
thanos,[satisfied.] Show me.
groot,[irritably] I am Groot.
Rocket Raccoon,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
groot,[still irritably] I am Groot.
Thor,"[while looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again."
Rocket Raccoon,You speak Groot?
Thor,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
groot,[shortly] I am Groot.
Thor,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
Rocket Raccoon,"[to himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [walks to a console near by Thor], presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying."
Thor,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."
Rocket Raccoon,And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor,Both dead.
Rocket Raccoon,"Still got a mom, though?"
Thor,Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket Raccoon,A best friend?
Thor,Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket Raccoon,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor,"[smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is."
Thor,"Well, he's never fought me."
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, he has!"
Thor,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget."
Rocket Raccoon,Better be some hammer.
Thor,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."
Rocket Raccoon,And what if you're wrong?
Thor,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?
Rocket Raccoon,[under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [he gives Thor the eyeball]
Thor,What's this?
Rocket Raccoon,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor,He gave you his eye?
Rocket Raccoon,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor,"Thank you, sweet rabbit."
Rocket Raccoon,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!"
Thor,[Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket Raccoon,It ain't the eye.
Thor,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
Rocket Raccoon,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.
Thor,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...
Rocket Raccoon,"[pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?"
Thor,Yes. Why?
Rocket Raccoon,"Look anything like that? [in fact, it looks exactly like that]"
groot,[uneasily] I am Groot.
Thor,[urgently] Go back to the pod.
Thor,"Eitri, wait! Stop!"
eitri,Thor?
Thor,What happened here?
eitri,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
Thor,"Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?"
eitri,"[he walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. ""Your life is yours."" he said. ""But your hands are mine alone."" [he holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal]"
Thor,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer, sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."
Nebula,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan."
peter parker,"[to Tony] Hey, what's going on?"
doctor e,I think we're here.
Tony Stark,I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
peter parker,"Yep, got it."
Tony Stark,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
peter parker,Okay. Okay. Ready.
peter parker,We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!
Tony Stark,[to e] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.
peter parker,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry."
Tony Stark,[while pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
peter parker,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.
Drax,"[yelling] THANOS!!!! [he flings a blade at Doctor e, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure]"
peter parker,"[crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!"
peter quill,"Stay down, clown!"
Drax,"[struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!"
peter quill,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are... Chill the F out. [Quill powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?"
Tony Stark,"[de-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?"
Drax,I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!
peter quill,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak."
Tony Stark,"Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nanotech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face]"
Drax,"Do it, Quill! I can take it."
Mantis,"No, he can't take it!"
Steven e,[completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.
peter quill,Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [to Spidey] Starting with you.
Steven e,What master do you serve?
peter quill,"What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?"
Tony Stark,[getting it] You're from Earth?
peter quill,I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?"
peter parker,"[sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?"
peter quill,"[indignantly] WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl. Wait... who are you?"
peter parker,"[de-helmets] We're the Avengers, man."
peter quill,Oh.
Mantis,You're the ones Thor told us about!
Tony Stark,You know Thor!?
peter quill,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving."
doctor e,[pause] Where is he now?
Rocket Raccoon,This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
eitri,"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost."
Thor,Did it have a name?
eitri,Stormbreaker.
Rocket Raccoon,That's a bit much.
Thor,So how do we make it?
eitri,You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor,"Rabbit, fire up the pod."
peter quill,The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet."
Tony Stark,"Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?"
Drax,"I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan."""
Tony Stark,"[to Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page."
peter quill,"See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do."
peter parker,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do?"
Mantis,"[as fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass."
Drax,"Yeah, that's right. [agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the Avengers]"
Tony Stark,"[Iron Man pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?"
peter quill,"""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine. [motions to Drax and Mantis]"
Tony Stark,We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...
peter quill,"Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Spider-Man follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]"
Drax,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony Stark,What dance-off?
peter quill,It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.
peter parker,"Like in Footloose, the movie?"
peter quill,[excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
peter parker,It never was.
Tony Stark,"Don't encourage this, alright?"
peter parker,Okay.
Tony Stark,We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
peter quill,"Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you."
Tony Stark,Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis,"Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?"
Tony Stark,e! We alright?
Tony Stark,You're back. You're alright.
peter parker,"Hey, what was that?"
doctor e,[panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
peter quill,How many did you see?
doctor e,14000605
Tony Stark,How many did we win?
Steven e,[pause] One.
thanos,The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.
stonekeeper,"Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
thanos,You know us?
stonekeeper,It is my curse to know all who journey here.
thanos,Where's the Soul Stone?
stonekeeper,You should know... it extracts a terrible price.
thanos,I am prepared.
thanos,How is it you know this place so well?
red skull,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
red skull,What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
thanos,What's this?
red skull,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
thanos,Tell me what it needs.
red skull,To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.
thanos,Of what?
red skull,In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.
Gamora,"All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
thanos,[turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes]
Gamora,Really? Tears?
red skull,They're not for him.
Gamora,No. This isn't love.
thanos,"[Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jewelled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [he grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice]"
Gamora,NO!
Steve Rogers,"[walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0."
Sam Wilson,"I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to."
okoye,[Walking with T'Challa and a band of the King's Guard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.
T'challa,And what did you imagine?
okoye,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
Bruce Banner,[to Rhodey] Should we bow?
james rhodes,"[seriously] Yeah, he's a king."
Steve Rogers,Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [shaking hands with T'Challa]
james rhodes,[mock shocked] What are you doing?
T'challa,"Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?"
Bruce Banner,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault."
Natasha Romanov,How we looking?
T'challa,"You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and..."
Bucky Barnes,"[smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man."
Steve Rogers,"How you been, Buck?"
Bucky Barnes,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world."
shuri,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce Banner,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially."
shuri,Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
Bruce Banner,"[uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it."
shuri,"[reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best."
Wanda Maximoff,Can you do it?
shuri,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [to T'Challa] It will take time, brother."
Steve Rogers,How long?
shuri,As long as you can give me.
okoye,"[her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere."
Sam Wilson,"[over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here."
Bucky Barnes,"God, I love this place."
james rhodes,"[also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome."
Vision,[struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha Romanov,"[moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table."
T'challa,"We will hold them off. [he, Okoye and the guards head for the door]"
Steve Rogers,"[to Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell."
Wanda Maximoff,I will.
T'challa,"Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [he stops, turns, and points at Cap] And get this man a shield."
Rocket Raccoon,"I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose."
Thor,Leave that to me.
Rocket Raccoon,"Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-"
Rocket Raccoon,[Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal] Nnnyah!
Thor,"[As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!"
eitri,"Well done, boy."
Thor,That's Nivadellir!
eitri,Damn it.
Rocket Raccoon,"""Damn it""? What's ""damn it""?"
eitri,The mechanism is crippled.
Thor,What?
eitri,With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
Thor,How long will it take to heat?
eitri,"A few minutes, maybe more. Why?"
Thor,[standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.
eitri,That's suicide.
Thor,So is facing Thanos without that axe. [he leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]
Natasha Romanov,"How we looking, Bruce?"
Bruce Banner,"[leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually- [He stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay."
james rhodes,I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
jabari warriors,"MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as T'Challa nears him]"
T'challa,[clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.
m'baku,"[translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother."
Natasha Romanov,Where's your other friend?
proxima midnight,You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve Rogers,That's not gonna happen.
T'challa,You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
proxima midnight,"We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their ""passengers"" to disembark.]"
Bucky Barnes,[a touch sardonically] Did they surrender?
Steve Rogers,Not exactly.
Bucky Barnes,"[flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell."
Natasha Romanov,Looks like we pissed her off.
okoye,"[horrified, as the Outriders bombard the forcefield, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected] They're killing themselves."
Sam Wilson,"[Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?"
james rhodes,"Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]"
Bruce Banner,"Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision."
Steve Rogers,[grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
okoye,[to T'Challa] How do we do that?
T'challa,"We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen."
dome control,"Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?"
T'challa,On my signal.
m'baku,[to Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.
okoye,Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
T'challa,"WAKANDA FOREVER! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!"
T'challa,"[over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?"
shuri,"We've barely begun, brother. [a delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself]"
T'challa,You might want to pick up the pace.
Thor,"Allfathers, give me strength."
eitri,"You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you."
Thor,Only if I die. [takes deep breaths]
eitri,"[boggled] Yes. That's what... ""killing you"" means."
eitri,"Hold it! Hold it, Thor!"
Rocket Raccoon,"[Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from ""okay"".]"
Rocket Raccoon,I think he's dying!
eitri,"He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!"
Bruce Banner,There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!
Bruce Banner,[opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!
Thor,"BRING ME THANOS!!! [he charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]"
doctor e,"[sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a ""Thanos""."
thanos,"I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
doctor e,You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
thanos,"And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor e]"
doctor e,Let me guess. Your home?
thanos,"[Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show e Titan before it was destroyed - green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
doctor e,Genocide.
thanos,"But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [he relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan]"
doctor e,[sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.
thanos,I'm a survivor.
doctor e,Who wants to murder trillions.
thanos,"With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...mercy."
doctor e,[stands] And then what?
thanos,I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
doctor e,"[he summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours."
thanos,"Ours? [he looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]"
Tony Stark,"[flying in] Piece of cake, Quill."
peter quill,"[triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!"
peter quill,Boom!
Steven e,"[whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [the Cloak swoops off Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos's armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]"
peter parker,"Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos's head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a-"
thanos,Insect!
thanos,"Well, well."
Nebula,You should have killed me.
thanos,Would've been a waste of parts!
Nebula,"[she runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!"
Tony Stark,[while pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.
Mantis,[starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.
Tony Stark,"Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his webline, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go."
peter quill,"[flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly.] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?"
thanos,My... Gamora...?
peter quill,"No, bullshit. Where is she?"
Mantis,[shocked] He is in anguish.
peter quill,Good.
Mantis,[crying] He… he… mourns.
Drax,What does this monster have to mourn?!
Nebula,Gamora.
peter quill,[pause] What?
Nebula,[realising with horror and sadness what has happened.] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.
Tony Stark,"[grasps the danger immediately and dehelmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?"
Tony Stark,"[shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!"
peter quill,Tell me she's lying. [enraged] ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!
thanos,I... had... to.
peter quill,"[while starting to tear up; quietly] [while starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't…! No, you didn't…! [he continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain] [he continues to rage and then proceeds to pistol-whipping Thanos in the face] NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!"
Tony Stark,Quill!
Tony Stark,"[to the struggling Quill] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!"
peter parker,It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it...!
peter parker,"[seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [he jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing]"
Rocket Raccoon,"[having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. Bucky, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [Bucky drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?"
Bucky Barnes,[snaps off another burst] Not for sale.
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, how much for the arm? [Bucky just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm."
Steve Rogers,[panting] New haircut?
Thor,[grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.
Thor,"By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]"
groot,[in full battle snarl] I am GROOT!
Steve Rogers,"[formally, but bemused] I... I am Steve Rogers."
T'challa,Fall back! Fall back now!
james rhodes,"Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam."
Sam Wilson,I'm doing it. [the two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot]
okoye,[a touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?
proxima midnight,She's on the field. Take it.
Sam Wilson,"Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [he's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]"
Steve Rogers,Somebody get to Vision!
Bruce Banner,I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]
Wanda Maximoff,On my way. [she is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]
proxima midnight,[jumping down next to Wanda] He'll die alone. As will you.
Natasha Romanov,She's not alone.
proxima midnight,"Euuyaaah! [she leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]"
Bruce Banner,"Ohh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]"
Bruce Banner,"Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back] [trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!"
Bruce Banner,[Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!
Bruce Banner,"Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [to Obsidian] Come on!"
Bruce Banner,"See ya! [the repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air - high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal."
corvus glaive,"I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [he yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed]"
Steve Rogers,"Get outta here! [he exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defence, then turns to Vision again] GO!"
Natasha Romanov,That was really gross.
Steve Rogers,[helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.
Vision,"We don't trade lives, Captain."
peter parker,"[webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [snags Drax, securing both of them to something Not Moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [reels in Star-Lord]"
thanos,"You're full of tricks, wizard."
doctor e,[as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!
thanos,[he snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [he crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [he throws e hard enough that Strange's head hits stone and he passes out]
Tony Stark,"[sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it."
thanos,Stark.
Tony Stark,You know me?
thanos,I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
Tony Stark,My only curse is you. [small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos]
thanos,Come on!
thanos,[panting] All that for a drop of blood.
thanos,"You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [he lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you."
doctor e,Stop! [sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.
thanos,No tricks. [e shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead]
Tony Stark,Don't..!
thanos,"One to go. [an energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise]"
peter quill,"[screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos]"
peter quill,[standing and dehelmeting] Where is he?!
peter quill,[now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?
Tony Stark,"[to e, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?"
doctor e,We're in the Endgame now.
m'baku,MAYEFA!
jabari,YA HU!
Wanda Maximoff,[landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?
Vision,He's here.
Steve Rogers,"Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [he is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]"
Natasha Romanov,What the hell?
Bruce Banner,"[Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him."
Steve Rogers,Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Vision,Wanda. It's time.
Wanda Maximoff,No.
Vision,"They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone."
Wanda Maximoff,Don't.
Vision,"You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time."
Wanda Maximoff,I can't.
Vision,"Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies."
Wanda Maximoff,It's not fair.
Vision,"It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [Wanda extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]"
Vision,[very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.
thanos,"[walking closer to Wanda] I understand, my child. Better than anyone."
Wanda Maximoff,[snarls] You could never.
thanos,"[reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor e made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]"
Wanda Maximoff,No! [she lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]
Thor,"[lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that!"
thanos,[weakly] You should have... You... [suddenly stronger] You should have gone for the head! [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]
Thor,NO!
thanos,Daughter?
Gamora,Did you do it?
thanos,Yes.
Gamora,[beat] What did it cost?
thanos,[solemnly] Everything.
Thor,What'd you do? [angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!
Steve Rogers,"[stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?"
Bucky Barnes,Steve?
T'challa,"[while reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. But he suddenly disintegrates into ashes and an anguish Okoye falls back on the ground]"
okoye,Kumkani?!
Rocket Raccoon,"No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no."
james rhodes,"[searching for Falcon, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!"
Mantis,Something... is... happening. [she disintegrates into ashes]
Drax,[to Quill as he dissolves] Quill? [Quill stares in horror]
Tony Stark,"Steady, Quill."
peter quill,"Aw, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]"
doctor e,"[calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [he finally gets erased.]"
peter parker,[realizes he's fading away] Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...
Tony Stark,"[trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right."
peter parker,"[stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's- I don't know what's happening. I don't- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight and crying] Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms]"
Nebula,"[to Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it."
james rhodes,What is this? What the hell is happening?
Steve Rogers,"[pause] Oh, God."
Nick Fury,Still no word from Stark?
Maria Hill,"No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [receives three beeps from her device]"
Nick Fury,What is it?
Maria Hill,Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
Nick Fury,Same energy signatures as New York?
Maria Hill,Ten times bigger.
Nick Fury,Tell Klein. We'll meet him at-
Maria Hill,Nick! [a car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]
Nick Fury,They okay?
Maria Hill,There's no one here.
Nick Fury,Call Control. Code Red.
Maria Hill,Nick?
Nick Fury,Hill?
Nick Fury,"Oh, no. Motherf-"
lila,Mhm. 
Clint Barton,"Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]"
Clint Barton,Put your foot this way. Here. Can you see?
lila,Yeah.
Clint Barton,You sure?
lila,Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.]
Clint Barton,How about now?
Clint Barton,Alright. Ready your fingers.
cooper,Nice.
laura,"Nice throw, kiddo."
cooper,You go.
laura,"Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]"
lila,Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
Clint Barton,Probably your brothers. 
Clint Barton,"Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]"
laura,Mayo or mustard?
nathaniel,How about ketchup?
laura,Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter]
Clint Barton,Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.]
Clint Barton,"Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow."
laura,"Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!"
Clint Barton,"Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.]"
Clint Barton,"Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around]"
Clint Barton,"Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.]"
Clint Barton,"Honey? Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?"
Nebula,"Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony]"
Tony Stark,You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]
Tony Stark,"Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony]"
Tony Stark,That's a goal. You're now one a piece.
Nebula,I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]
Tony Stark,We tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun. 
Tony Stark,That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]
Tony Stark,And... you've won. Congratulations.  [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]
Tony Stark,Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand]
Tony Stark,Have fun?
Nebula,It was fun. 
Tony Stark,This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks weak and malnutrition.]
Tony Stark,"Hey, Miss Potts... Pep."
Tony Stark,"If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god,  I hope so."
Tony Stark,"Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.]"
Tony Stark,"You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.]"
Tony Stark,"You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebual working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.]"
Tony Stark,"But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7 -11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hooping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. It's always you."
Tony Stark,I couldn't stop him.
Steve Rogers,Neither could I.
Tony Stark,I lost the kid.
Steve Rogers,"Tony, we lost."
Tony Stark,Is ummm... [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]
Pepper Potts,Oh my god! [She and Tony embrace.]
Tony Stark,"It's okay. [In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing.]"
Natasha Romanov,"It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. An it looks like he did... exactly what he said he was going to do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures."
Tony Stark,Where is he now? Where?
Steve Rogers,We don't know.
Rocket Raccoon,"He just opened a portal and walked through. [Cut to a shot of a sullen looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]"
Tony Stark,What's wrong with him?
Rocket Raccoon,"He's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but there's a lot of that's goin' around, ain't there?"
Tony Stark,"Honestly, until this exact second, I though you were a Build-A-Bear."
Rocket Raccoon,Maybe I am.
Natasha Romanov,"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans and satellites, and we got nothing."
Steve Rogers,"Tony, you fought him."
Tony Stark,"Who told you that? I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That's what happened. There was no fight."
Steve Rogers,"Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?"
Tony Stark,Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus."
Tony Stark,And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need. 
Tony Stark,"I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling you, Cap."
Rhodey,"Tony, Tony, Tony, stop!"
Tony Stark,Otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Wether it impacted our precious freedom or not- that's what we needed!
Steve Rogers,"Well, that didn't work out, did it?"
Tony Stark,"I said, ""we'll lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, cap? We lost. You weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers, right?"
Rhodey,"Okay, you made your point. Just sit down, ok?"
Tony Stark,"Nah, nah, nah. [He pushes Rhodey away] Here's my point."
Rhodey,Sit down!
Tony Stark,"[Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way. We need you. You're new blood. "
Rhodey,Tony!
Tony Stark,"Bunch of tired old mills! I got nothing for you, cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no plan, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar. "
Tony Stark,"Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide."
Steve Rogers,Tony!
Tony Stark,I'm fine. I...
Rhodey,Bruce gave him sedative. He's gonna be out for the rest of the day.
Carol Danvers,You guys take care of him. And I'll bring Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
Rhodey,Where are you going?
Carol Danvers,To kill Thanos.
Natasha Romanov,"You know, we usually work as a team around here, and between you and I, we're also a little fragile. We realize this is more your territory, but this is our fight too."
Rocket Raccoon,Do you even know where he is?
Carol Danvers,I know people who might.
Nebula,To the Garden.
Rhodey,"That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan."
Steve Rogers,So where is he then?
Rocket Raccoon,"When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.]"
Nebula,On this planet. Thanos is there.
Natasha Romanov,He used the stones again.
Bruce Banner,"Hey, Hey, we'd be going in short-handed, you know."
Rhodey,"Look, he's still got the stones, so..."
Carol Danvers,So let's get him. We'll use them to bring everyone back.
Rhodey,Just like that?
Steve Rogers,"Yeah, just like that."
Natasha Romanov,Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
Bruce Banner,"If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?"
Carol Danvers,"Because before, you didn't have me."
Rhodey,"Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time."
Carol Danvers,"There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys."
Thor,I like this one.
Steve Rogers,Let's go get this son of a bitch. [Cut to a shot of everyone except for Carol and Tony aboard the Benatar.]
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, who here hasn't been to space? [Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]"
Rhodey,Why?
Rocket Raccoon,You better not throw up on my ship. Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
Carol Danvers,I'll head down for ground recon.
Natasha Romanov,"This is gonna work, Steve."
Steve Rogers,I know it will.
Steve Rogers,Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
Carol Danvers,"No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him."
Nebula,Then that's enough.
Rocket Raccoon,Oh no.
Natasha Romanov,Where are they?
Carol Danvers,Answer the question!
thanos,"The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation."
Bruce Banner,You murdered trillions!
thanos,You should be thankful.
Steve Rogers,Where are the stones?
thanos,Gone. Reduced to atoms.
Bruce Banner,You used them two days ago!
thanos,I used the stones to destroy the stones. It... nearly killed me. But the work is done. it always will be. I am inevitable.
Rhodey,"We have to tear this place apart, he has to be lying."
Nebula,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
thanos,"Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly."
Rocket Raccoon,What... What did you do?
Thor,I went for the head.
man #1,"So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. First time in five years, you know? Sit there, dinner... I didn't know what to talk about."
Steve Rogers,What did you talk about?
man #1,"Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. Then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads."
man #2,How about you?
man #1,"I cried just before dessert. But I'm seeing him tomorrow, so..."
Steve Rogers,"That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. [Another man during the therapy session is seen starting to tear up.] And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps you gotta take. To try and become whole again. To try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You got to move on. Got to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we have to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed us all."
Scott Lang,"[grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.] What the hell?"
Scott Lang,Hope?
Scott Lang,[yells] Kid! Hey kid!
Scott Lang,What the hell happened here?
Scott Lang,"No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if her daughter hadn't had her name on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no."
Scott Lang,"[in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]"
Scott Lang,What?
Scott Lang,Cassie?
cassie,"Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]"
Scott Lang,You're so big!
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship that Danvers pinged."
Nebula,It was an infectious garbage scowl.
Rocket Raccoon,"So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]"
Carol Danvers,"Well, you were closer."
Rocket Raccoon,Yeah. And we smell like garbage.
Natasha Romanov,[turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?
okoye,It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
Natasha Romanov,Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
okoye,"Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it."
Natasha Romanov,"[turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?"
Carol Danvers,Not likely.
Rocket Raccoon,"[realizing that she got a new haircut] What, you gonna get a new haircut?"
Carol Danvers,"[irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets."
Rocket Raccoon,[murmurs to himself] That's a good point. That's a good point.
Carol Danvers,So you might not see me for a long time.
Natasha Romanov,"Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me."
okoye,Okay.
Natasha Romanov,"Alright. [One by one, the Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]"
Carol Danvers,Good luck. [cuts off call]
Natasha Romanov,Where are you?
Rhodey,Mexico. The federales found a room filled with bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
Natasha Romanov,It's probably a rival gang.
Rhodey,Except it isn't. [Nat realizes something.]
Rhodey,"It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left..."
Rhodey,"I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him."
Natasha Romanov,Will you find out where he's going next?
Rhodey,Nat...
Natasha Romanov,Please.
Rhodey,[reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his] [Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.]
Steve Rogers,"You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]"
Natasha Romanov,You here to do your laundry?
rogers,And to see a friend.
Natasha Romanov,"[referring to herself] Clearly, your friend is fine."
Steve Rogers,You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
Natasha Romanov,In the Hudson?
Steve Rogers,"There's fewer ships, cleaner water."
Natasha Romanov,"You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]"
Steve Rogers,"[Walks and talks to her...] Sorry. Force of habit. [...and throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair.]"
Steve Rogers,"You know, I keep telling everyone they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us."
Natasha Romanov,"If I move on, who does this?"
Steve Rogers,Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
Natasha Romanov,[Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
Steve Rogers,We both need to get a life.
Natasha Romanov,[Smiling] You first.
Scott Lang,"Uh... Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me."
Steve Rogers,[Standing up] Is this an old message?
Natasha Romanov,[Also standing up] It's the front gate.
Scott Lang,"Ant-man? Ant-man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys."
Steve Rogers,Are you okay?
Scott Lang,Yeah. I'm fine.
Scott Lang,Have either of you ever studied Quantum Physics?
Natasha Romanov,Only in mid-conversation.
Scott Lang,"Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there."
Natasha Romanov,I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
Scott Lang,"Yeah, but that's just it. For me it was five hours."
Scott Lang,"See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving."
Steve Rogers,"Scott, what are you talking about?"
Scott Lang,"What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos."
Steve Rogers,"Wait, are you talking about a time machine?"
Scott Lang,"No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... No, it's crazy."
Natasha Romanov,"I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore."
Steve Rogers,So who do we talk to about this?
Tony Stark,Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.]
Tony Stark,Morgoona? Morgan H. Stark.
Tony Stark,"Want some lunch? Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a helmet similar to Iron Man, with white replacing the red.]"
morgan,Okay.
Tony Stark,"You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. [Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.] There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? Want a handful of crickets?"
morgan,No.
Tony Stark,That's what you want. How did you find this?
morgan,Garage.
Tony Stark,Really? Were you looking for it?
morgan,No. I found it though.
Tony Stark,"You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Mum never wears anything I wear."
Scott Lang,"[Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony] Now, we know what it sounds like..."
Steve Rogers,"Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?"
Tony Stark,"Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale, which then triggers the Deutsch proposition. Can we agree on that?"
Tony Stark,"Thank-you. In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home."
Scott Lang,I did.
Tony Stark,"No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?"
Scott Lang,[looking embarrassed] A time heist?
Tony Stark,"Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?"
Scott Lang,The stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
Natasha Romanov,We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
Tony Stark,"Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?"
Steve Rogers,I don't believe we would.
Tony Stark,"Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise."
Scott Lang,"Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -"
Tony Stark,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?"
Scott Lang,No.
Tony Stark,Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
Natasha Romanov,Tony... We have to take a stand.
Tony Stark,"We did stand. And yet, here we are."
Scott Lang,"I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. Bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even..."
Tony Stark,"That's right, Scott, I won't. Leave it. Got a kid."
morgan,Mommy told me to come and save you.
Tony Stark,"Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six."
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance."
Tony Stark,"I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch."
Natasha Romanov,He's scared.
Steve Rogers,He's not wrong.
Scott Lang,"Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna top?"
Steve Rogers,"No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain."
Scott Lang,"[Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house] Bigger than his?"
Bruce Banner,"Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs."
Scott Lang,I'm so confused.
Bruce Banner,[seriously] These are confusing times.
Scott Lang,"Right. No, no, that's not what I meant."
Bruce Banner,"[dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now."
Scott Lang,Yeah! How? Why?
Bruce Banner,"Five years ago, we got our asses beat. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost."
Natasha Romanov,"No one blamed you, Bruce."
Bruce Banner,"I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Bets of both worlds..."
girl,"Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?"
Bruce Banner,Yes?
girl,Can we get a photo?
Bruce Banner,"100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?"
Scott Lang,Oh.
Bruce Banner,"Say ""green""! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]"
Bruce Banner,Did you get that? That's good.
Scott Lang,[leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
Scott Lang,"They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does."
Bruce Banner,"Wait, no, no, he wants to... [to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]"
Scott Lang,He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either. I don't want a picture with them.
Bruce Banner,[To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.
Scott Lang,I don't want it anymore.
Bruce Banner,You'd feel bad.
Scott Lang,Just take the goddamn phone.
girl,"Thank you, Mr. Hulk."
Bruce Banner,"No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. Hulk out!"
Steve Rogers,Bruce.
Bruce Banner,[Awkwardly] Dab!
Steve Rogers,Bruce.
Bruce Banner,Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
Scott Lang,About we were saying...
Bruce Banner,"Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise."
Natasha Romanov,"Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too."
Tony Stark,"Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please."
friday,Processing...
Tony Stark,"Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. Gotta take a second."
friday,Just a moment.
Tony Stark,And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
friday,Model rendered.
Tony Stark,Shit!
morgan,Shit!
Tony Stark,"What are you doing up, little miss?"
morgan,Shit!
Tony Stark,"No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her."
morgan,Why you up?
Tony Stark,Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think? I got something on my mind.I got something on my mind.
morgan,Was it Juice Pops?
Tony Stark,"Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... my mind. [In Morgan's room]"
Tony Stark,"You done? Yeah, now you are. [Pushing Morgan's head onto her pillow] That face goes there."
morgan,Tell me a story.
Tony Stark,"A story. Once upon a time, a girl went to bed. The end."
morgan,[Giggling] That ain't the whole story.
Tony Stark,"Come on, that's your favourite story. I love you tons."
morgan,I love you 3000.
Tony Stark,"Wow. 3000. That's crazy. Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night."
Tony Stark,"Not that it's a competition or anything, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 scale. [Pepper scoffs]"
Tony Stark,[Absentmindedly] What are you reading?
Pepper Potts,"Oh, it's just a book on composting."
Tony Stark,[Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?
Pepper Potts,Just -
Tony Stark,"I figured it out, by the way."
Pepper Potts,"You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -"
Tony Stark,Time travel.
Pepper Potts,"What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying."
Tony Stark,That's right.
Pepper Potts,I got really lucky.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I know."
Pepper Potts,A lot of people didn't.
Tony Stark,"No, I can't help everybody."
Pepper Potts,It sorta seems like you can.
Tony Stark,"Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop."
Pepper Potts,"Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life."
Tony Stark,I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
Pepper Potts,But would you be able to rest?
Bruce Banner,"Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... van thing."
Steve Rogers,"Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby."
Bruce Banner,"Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose tiny here in the 1950s. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]"
Scott Lang,Excuse me?
Natasha Romanov,He's kidding. [To Bruce] You can't say things like that.
Bruce Banner,Just... It was a bad joke.
Natasha Romanov,"You were kidding, right?"
Bruce Banner,"I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [presses a few buttons] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, you'll walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?"
Scott Lang,Perfectly not confusing
Steve Rogers,"Good luck, Scott. You got this."
Scott Lang,"You're right, Captain America, I do."
Bruce Banner,On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!
teen scott,Guys? This doesn't feel right.
Steve Rogers,What's going on?
Bruce Banner,Hold on.
Natasha Romanov,Who is that?
Steve Rogers,Is that Scott?
teen scott,"Yes, this is Scott!"
old scott,Ow! My back!
Steve Rogers,Can you bring him back?
Bruce Banner,I'm working on it!
Steve Rogers,It's a baby.
Bruce Banner,It's Scott.
Steve Rogers,As a baby!
Bruce Banner,He'll grow!
Steve Rogers,Bring Scott back.
Bruce Banner,"[motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power. And... Kill it!"
Scott Lang,"Somebody peed my pants. I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me. Or just ""me"" me."
Bruce Banner,Time travel!
Steve Rogers,What?
Bruce Banner,I see this as an absolute win!
Tony Stark,He turned into a baby.
Steve Rogers,"Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?"
Tony Stark,"[Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody shoulda cautioned you against it."
Steve Rogers,You did.
Tony Stark,"[Opening his car's trunk] Oh, did I? Thank god I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it."
Steve Rogers,Me too.
Tony Stark,"Bring back everyone? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And maybe not die trying will be nice."
Steve Rogers,"Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.]"
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I don't know..."
Tony Stark,"Why? He made it for you. Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
Steve Rogers,"Thank you, Tony"
Tony Stark,"Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, yeah?"
Steve Rogers,We're working on that right now.
Rocket Raccoon,"Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?"
Scott Lang,"Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Rocket with a gun] That's awesome. [He starts to eat his taco, but Nebula lands right in front of him at full speed. Everything inside the taco falls out as Scott gets spooked]"
Nebula,"[into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone."
Scott Lang,"Oh, God!"
Rhodey,"What's up, regular sized man?"
Rocket Raccoon,Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.
Bruce Banner,"Have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]"
valkyrie,You shouldn't have come!
Bruce Banner,"Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl!"
valkyrie,[Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
Bruce Banner,[motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.
Rocket Raccoon,How you doin'?
valkyrie,[Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.
Bruce Banner,"That bad, huh?"
valkyrie,"We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs on the side] ... supplies."
Rocket Raccoon,It's that bad.
Bruce Banner,Yeah.
Bruce Banner,[Grimacing at the smell] What the...
Rocket Raccoon,Woo! Something died in here.
Bruce Banner,Hello? Thor?
Thor,[From another room.] Are you here about the cable?
Thor,"The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there] Boys! Oh my God! How have you been? [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal!"
Rocket Raccoon,"No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary."
Thor,"Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?"
Bruce Banner,"Hey, boys!"
korg,"Hey guys. Long time no see. Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again."
Thor,Noobmaster?
korg,"Yeah, Noobmaster69."
Thor,"Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel!"
korg,"Thank you, Thor."
Thor,"Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?"
korg,Thank you very much. I will.
Thor,"So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things."
Bruce Banner,"Buddy, you all right?"
Rocket Raccoon,You look like melted ice cream.
Thor,"[Laughs] So, what's up?"
Bruce Banner,We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
Thor,"What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks."
Bruce Banner,Like Thanos.
Thor,Don't say that name.
korg,"Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here."
Bruce Banner,"[quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you."
Thor,"Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off."
korg,Umm... Stormbreaker?
Thor,"Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?"
Bruce Banner,"I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?"
Thor,I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
Bruce Banner,It was you. You helped me.
Thor,"[walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway."
Bruce Banner,I think we can bring them back.
Thor,"Stop. Just, stop... [opens a packet on m&ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?"
korg,"Nah, all good here, mate!"
Thor,"So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye."
Bruce Banner,"[from offscreen] We need you, pal."
Rocket Raccoon,[Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.
Thor,"[pauses, but doesn't look up] What kind?"
ronin,[Also in Japanese] You're done hurting people.
akihiko,You're crazy!
akihiko,[In English] Wait! Help me! I'll do anything you want!
ronin,"[Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me."
Clint Barton,You shouldn't be here.
Natasha Romanov,Neither should you.
Clint Barton,I've got a job to do.
Natasha Romanov,Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
Natasha Romanov,"We found something. A chance, maybe..."
Clint Barton,[Now openly crying] Don't! Don't give me hope!
Natasha Romanov,I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
Tony Stark,"[To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] How's it going, Ratchet?"
Rocket Raccoon,"It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal."
Tony Stark,[Unfazed] Yup.
Bruce Banner,Time travel suit? Not bad.
Scott Lang,"[Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!"
Bruce Banner,I'm being very careful.
Scott Lang,"No, you're being very Hulky."
Bruce Banner,I'm being careful.
Scott Lang,"[Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more."
Steve Rogers,"Scott, calm down!"
Scott Lang,"Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run."
Scott Lang,All right. I'm not ready for this.
Bruce Banner,I'm game.
Clint Barton,I'll do it.
Bruce Banner,"Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift."
Clint Barton,[Taking position on the platform] Don't worry about it.
Rhodey,"Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, and..."
Bruce Banner,"First of all, that's horrible."
Rhodey,It's Thanos.
Bruce Banner,"And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future."
Rhodey,"Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. Bingo."
Tony Stark,That's not how it works.
Rhodey,"Well, that's what I heard."
Tony Stark,What? By who? Who told you that?
Rhodey,"Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -"
Scott Lang,Quantum Leap -
Rhodey,"A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -"
Scott Lang,Hot Tub Time Machine -
Rhodey,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel."
Scott Lang,"Die Hard? No, it's not..."
Rhodey,This is known.
Bruce Banner,"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future..."
Tony Stark,Exactly.
Scott Lang,So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
Bruce Banner,"[Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!"
lila,Cooper? Where are my headphones?
Clint Barton,"[murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]"
lila,Dad? [She looks around] Dad?
