# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-on-Marvel
#So this is my first real project using Python and various libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib etc.
My project involved 3 general steps


-> _Data Gathering_

   I have searched for the Marvel movie transcrits but was only able to find a cumulative transcript with all the marvel movie scripts.
   From the gathered csv file I have extracted the two movie transcripts and placed them in a separate file which is _Avengers infinity war & endgame.csv_
   
  
-> _Data Cleansing & Transformation_

   Later, I went onto cleaning the collected data to equip only the 6 Avengers in my column data. I did this through various concepts in python like lists, indexing, parameter calling etc.
   
   
-> _Plotting_

   Though plotting was my first time, it was very fun as I have learnt many things on the go. I have used the function value_counts() on my transformed data to derive the count of the dialogues of each character. Once I got my desired data, I used the plot function against it to visualize the desired result. Later, I applied many transformations such as styles, colors, size, headings etc to make it presentable.
